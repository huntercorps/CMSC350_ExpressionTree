# CMSC350_ExpressionTree

#CMSC 350 Project 2
The second programming project involves writing a program that accepts an arithmetic expression of unsigned integers in postfix notation and builds the arithmetic expression tree that represents that expression. From that tree, the corresponding fully parenthesized infix expression should be displayed and a file should be generated that contains the three address format instructions.
